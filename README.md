# Hypothesis-Testing: A Data-Science Project
**Topic**: Social media usage affects the user’s anxiety levels.

With given user responses from google form we come up with an evidence-based conclusion to the theory.  

Social media has now become an integral part of our daily lives. It’s more than just
a medium for people to connect and communicate with each other.  This study is
conducted to investigate whether social media usage affects people’s mental health in any
way. To aid this investigation data from more than 70 participants was gathered through
a survey that asked about their social media usage patterns as well as their emotional
reactions and how it affects their mental health. A quantitative analysis was performed
to test the hypothesis.
