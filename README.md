# Hypothesis-Testing: A Data-Science Project
**Topic**: Social media usage affects the user’s anxiety levels.

With given user responses from google form we come up with an evidence-based conclusion to the theory.  

**Description:** Social media has now become an integral part of our daily lives. It’s more than just
a medium for people to connect and communicate with each other.  This study is
conducted to investigate whether social media usage affects people’s mental health in any
way. To aid this investigation data from more than 70 participants was gathered through
a survey that asked about their social media usage patterns as well as their emotional
reactions and how it affects their mental health. A quantitative analysis was performed
to test the hypothesis.

**Instructions:** The paper follows a standard thesis format and can be found in the repository as a PDF. Additionally, the Jupyter notebook (hypothesis_testing_analysis.ipynb) in this repository contains the code used to process the data, perform hypothesis testing (such as t-tests and chi-square tests), and generate results with visualizations. To get started, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the notebook. The paper and notebook together offer a comprehensive guide to understanding the analysis and results, along with clear instructions for reproducing the findings.
